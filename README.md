# BinaryTree-Java
Example of a Binary Tree developed on Java. Not only the interface shows the new structure of the binary tree when you add or delete data, but also allows you to search for an element or add data from a file.

The data must be an integer number (That´s the reason we include the file "numbers.txt").
